# Loan Approval Prediction
In this project, I aim to predict loan approval status using various machine learning algorithms.
The process involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and model Evaluation using
different classification and Regression algorithms.

# Introduction
The objective of this project is to build a machine-learning model that can predict whether
a loan will be approved or not based on the applicant's information.
This is a binary classification problem where the target variable indicates the loan approval status.
